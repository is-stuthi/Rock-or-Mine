Sonar Signal Classification: Rock vs. Mine
This project implements a Binary Classification model to distinguish between sonar signals reflected off a mine and those reflected off a rock. This is a classic machine learning problem.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains 208 instances with 60 features each. Each feature represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.
Label M: Represents a Mine.
Label R: Represents a Rock.
Distribution: 111 Mines, 97 Rocks.
